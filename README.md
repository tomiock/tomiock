## Artificial Intelligence Undergrad

I code and I try to make deep learning stuff. Pursuing a research career, interest on neural scaling laws.
[Check my website](https://tomiock.com/) to see my "porfolio" and more info. I have articles and some tools.

### Projects:
- [Deep Learning Framework](https://github.com/tomiock/macrograd) from scratch (CUDA is missing :(
- [Quantum Machine Learning](https://github.com/tomiock/quantum-GAN), a high school research project
- [Computer Vision and League of Legends](https://github.com/tomiock/LeagueOfLegends-Analytics) (yes, really)


### Workflow
- [Nix/NixOS](https://github.com/tomiock/nix-config) my dot files, you can copy my computer from these
- [Neovim](https://github.com/tomiock/neovimrc) the best editor, "simplicity" is the key
